# Republic

Republic is a JS engine written in C99. The goal of this project is to achieve
a very basic Javascript implementation. This basically means the **CORE**
features of the language. No extra classes, just variables and how you can
interact with them and such. So the `document` and `console` objects are out of
scope for now. Though I will implement some basic features of `console` for io,
but that's about it.
